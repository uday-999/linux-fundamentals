# 🚀 Day 26 – Linux Networking: VM Setup & Network Fundamentals

## 📌 Overview
Today I started the Networking module in my Linux journey.  
This section covers how Linux systems connect to networks and communicate.

# 🌐 1️⃣ Enable Internet in VirtualBox VM

## Steps:

1. Open VirtualBox
2. Select your Linux VM
3. Click **Settings**
4. Go to **Network**
5. Choose **Bridged Adapter**
6. Click OK
7. Start the VM

## ✅ Verify Internet Connectivity

```bash
ping www.google.com
````

If packets are received, internet is working correctly.

# 🌍 2️⃣ Network Fundamentals

## 🔹 IP Address

An IP address uniquely identifies a device on a network.

* IPv4 → `192.168.1.10`
* IPv6 → `2001:db8::1`

---

## 🔹 Subnet Mask

Divides IP into:

* Network portion
* Host portion

Example:

```
IP Address: 192.168.1.10
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
```

---

## 🔹 Default Gateway

The router IP that connects your local network to the internet.

Example:

```
192.168.1.1
```

---

## 🔹 Static vs DHCP

| Type   | Description               |
| ------ | ------------------------- |
| Static | Manually assigned IP      |
| DHCP   | Automatically assigned IP |

---

# 🛠 3️⃣ Basic Network Commands

## Show IP addresses

```bash
ip a
```

## Show routing table

```bash
ip route
```

## Test connectivity

```bash
ping google.com
```
