# 🚀 Day 30 – SSH Basics & Remote Access
## 📌 Overview
Today I explored SSH (Secure Shell), which allows secure remote access to Linux servers over a network.

SSH is one of the most essential tools for System Administrators and DevOps Engineers.

# 🔐 1️⃣ What is SSH?

SSH (Secure Shell) is a secure protocol used to connect to remote systems.

Default Port: 22

It encrypts communication between client and server.

# 📦 2️⃣ Install SSH Server

### RHEL / CentOS / Amazon Linux
```bash
sudo yum install openssh-server

Ubuntu / Debian

sudo apt install openssh-server


---

▶ 3️⃣ Start & Enable SSH Service

Start SSH service:

sudo systemctl start sshd

Enable at boot:

sudo systemctl enable sshd

Check status:

sudo systemctl status sshd


---

🌐 4️⃣ Connect to a Remote Server

ssh username@server_ip

Example:

ssh uday@192.168.1.20


---

📡 5️⃣ Verify SSH Port is Listening

ss -tuln | grep 22


---

🔎 6️⃣ Basic Troubleshooting

If connection fails:

Check if sshd service is running

Check firewall rules

Confirm port 22 is open

Verify correct IP address

Check SELinux status (if enabled)
