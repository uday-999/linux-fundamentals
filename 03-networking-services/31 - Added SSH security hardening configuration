# 🚀 Day 31 – SSH Security Hardening

## 📌 Overview
Today I focused on securing SSH by modifying configuration settings.

Hardening SSH is essential to protect servers from unauthorized access and brute-force attacks.

# 🔐 1️⃣ SSH Configuration File

Main configuration file:

/etc/ssh/sshd_config

Edit the file:
```bash
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

After making changes, restart SSH:

sudo systemctl restart sshd


---

🚫 2️⃣ Disable Root Login

Find: PermitRootLogin yes

Change to: PermitRootLogin no

This prevents direct root login via SSH.


---

🔑 3️⃣ Disable Empty Password Login

Find: PermitEmptyPasswords yes

Change to: PermitEmptyPasswords no

Improves security by preventing blank-password logins.


---

👥 4️⃣ Allow Specific Users Only

Add the following line: AllowUsers username

Example: AllowUsers uday

Only listed users will be allowed to access SSH.


---

🔄 5️⃣ Change Default SSH Port

Default SSH port: 22

Change to custom port (example 2222): Port 2222

After changing:

Update firewall rules

Restart sshd service


Verify new port:

ss -tuln | grep 2222


---

⏱ 6️⃣ Set Idle Timeout

Add: ClientAliveInterval 300 ClientAliveCountMax 0

This disconnects idle sessions after 5 minutes.

🔥 Why SSH Hardening is Important

SSH is commonly targeted by attackers.

Proper configuration helps reduce:

Brute-force attacks

Unauthorized access

Security vulnerabilities
