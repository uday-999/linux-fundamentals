🚀 Day 27 – Linux Network Configuration Files & ip Command Deep Dive

Today we move one level deeper into networking.

📌 Topics Covered (Day 27)

🗂 1️⃣ Important Network Configuration Files

Understanding where Linux stores networking settings is critical for system administration.

🔹 /etc/hosts

Maps hostname → IP address

Used before DNS lookup


Example:

127.0.0.1   localhost
192.168.1.10  myserver


---

🔹 /etc/resolv.conf

Stores DNS server information


Example:

nameserver 8.8.8.8


---

🔹 /etc/nsswitch.conf

Controls lookup order (files, DNS, etc.)

Defines how name resolution works



---

🔹 RHEL-Based Systems

/etc/sysconfig/network

Contains global networking settings



---

🌐 2️⃣ Deep Dive into ip Command (Modern Replacement for ifconfig)

The ip command is part of the iproute2 package.


---

🔹 Show All Interfaces

ip a


---

🔹 Show Interface Status

ip link show


---

🔹 Show Routing Table

ip route


---

🔹 Assign Temporary IP

sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.20/24 dev eth0


---

🔹 Bring Interface Up / Down

sudo ip link set eth0 up
sudo ip link set eth0 down


---
