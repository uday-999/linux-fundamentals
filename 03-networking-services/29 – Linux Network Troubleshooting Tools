# 🚀 Day 29 – Linux Network Troubleshooting Tools

## 📌 Overview
Today I explored practical Linux network troubleshooting tools used in real-world server environments.

---

# 🔍 1️⃣ ss Command (Modern Replacement for netstat)

`ss` displays socket statistics and active network connections.

## Show all listening ports
```bash
ss -tuln
````

## Show TCP connections

```bash
ss -t
```

## Show UDP connections

```bash
ss -u
```

---

# 📊 2️⃣ netstat (Legacy Tool)

Older but still widely used in many systems.

## Show listening ports

```bash
netstat -tuln
```

---

# 📡 3️⃣ tcpdump – Packet Capture Tool

Used for monitoring and analyzing network traffic.

## Capture traffic on interface

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i eth0
```

## Capture traffic on specific port

```bash
sudo tcpdump port 22
```

---

# 🌐 4️⃣ traceroute

Shows the path packets take to reach a destination.

```bash
traceroute google.com
```

---

# 🔎 5️⃣ lsof -i

Displays which process is using a specific port.

```bash
lsof -i :22
```

# 🧠 What I Learned

* How to check open ports
* How to monitor active network connections
* How to capture packets
* How to trace network routes
* How to identify which process is using a port

---

# 🔥 Why This Matters

These tools are essential for:

* Debugging server issues
* Checking service availability
* Investigating suspicious network activity
* Performing system administration tasks
