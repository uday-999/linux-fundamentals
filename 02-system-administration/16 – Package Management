# 🐧 Day 16 – Package Management (YUM, DNF & RPM)
## Managing Software the SysAdmin Way

> Software management is not just installation — it is stability, security, and lifecycle control.

Package management is a **core System Administration skill**, especially on RHEL-based systems like Amazon Linux, CentOS, and Rocky Linux.

---

## 🎯 Why Package Management Matters

In production environments:

- Security updates must be applied safely
- Dependencies must resolve correctly
- Versions must remain consistent
- Broken upgrades must be recoverable
- Software must be verifiable and auditable

A professional SysAdmin never installs software manually from random sources — they use package managers.

# 📦 1️⃣ Understanding the Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| `yum` | High-level package manager (Amazon Linux 2) |
| `dnf` | Modern replacement for yum (RHEL 8+) |
| `rpm` | Low-level package tool |
| `repo` | Software repository configuration |

# 📥 2️⃣ Installing Packages

### Install a Package
```bash
sudo yum install nginx
````

### Install Without Prompt

```bash
sudo yum install -y git
```

### Install Specific Version

```bash
sudo yum install nginx-1.20.1
```

---

# 🔄 3️⃣ Updating Packages

### Update Single Package

```bash
sudo yum update nginx
```

### Update Entire System

```bash
sudo yum update
```

### Check Available Updates

```bash
yum check-update
```

---

# ❌ 4️⃣ Removing Packages

### Remove Package

```bash
sudo yum remove nginx
```

### Remove with Dependencies

```bash
sudo yum autoremove
```

---

# 🔍 5️⃣ Querying Packages with RPM

### Check Package Information

```bash
rpm -qi nginx
```

### List Installed Files

```bash
rpm -ql nginx
```

### Check Package Version

```bash
rpm -q nginx
```

### Verify Package Integrity

```bash
rpm -V nginx
```

### Find Which Package Owns a File

```bash
rpm -qf /usr/sbin/nginx
```

---

# 🌐 6️⃣ Repository Management

### List Enabled Repositories

```bash
yum repolist
```

### Show Repository Details

```bash
yum repoinfo
```

### Enable / Disable Repository

```bash
sudo yum-config-manager --enable repo-name
sudo yum-config-manager --disable repo-name
```

---

# 🧹 7️⃣ Cache Management

### Clean All Cached Data

```bash
sudo yum clean all
```

### Rebuild Metadata Cache

```bash
sudo yum makecache
```

---

# 🧪 8️⃣ Practical Lab

## Scenario: Install and Manage Nginx

```bash
# 1. Install nginx
sudo yum install -y nginx

# 2. Verify installation
rpm -qi nginx

# 3. Check installed files
rpm -ql nginx

# 4. Start service
sudo systemctl start nginx

# 5. Check service status
sudo systemctl status nginx

# 6. Remove package
sudo yum remove -y nginx
```

# 🔐 9️⃣ Best Practices in Production

✅ Always test updates in staging first
✅ Avoid unnecessary repositories
✅ Keep system updated regularly
✅ Monitor CVEs for installed packages
✅ Use version locking when required
✅ Avoid manual compilation unless necessary

# 📊 10️⃣ YUM vs RPM

| Feature               | YUM         | RPM        |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Dependency resolution | ✅ Automatic | ❌ Manual   |
| High-level management | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No       |
| Install local package | ✅ Yes       | ✅ Yes      |
| Query & verification  | ❌ Limited   | ✅ Advanced |

**Rule of thumb:**
Use `yum/dnf` for installation and updates.
Use `rpm` for inspection and verification.
